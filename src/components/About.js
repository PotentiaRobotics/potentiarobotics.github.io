          Hi! I’m Aditya, one of the founders and Project Lead of Potentia Robotics and a sophomore at TJHSST. I was inspired to pursue such a grand project by YouTubers like Mark Rober and Michael Reeves, who build large, grand robots and other machinery just for the sheer fun of it. In particular, Michael Reeves’ philosophy of building cool things just for the sake of it/for the learning experience instead of having some ulterior—monetary or otherwise—motive behind building that thing really resonated with me. As the Project Lead of Potentia Robotics, I’m responsible for managing the team as a whole, setting and following through with deadlines, and I serve as the bridge between each of the three subteams. I also do subteam-specific work (programming, designing, accounting, etc.) in each subteam.

          I’m Audhav Durai, one of the founders and the Software Lead for Potentia Robotics. Motivated by the research being done at various colleges and academic institutions, I (along with Aditya) founded and became a part of Potentia Robotics so we could tackle a high-level project on our own. Having the opportunity to conduct research that is being done in the real word as a highschooler is an amazing experience. My role on the team is to manage the programming subteam, which means keeping track of our progress, making sure we are always on task, and meeting both exterior and team-set deadlines. Additionally, I do various tasks in the programming subteam as well.

          Hi, I’m Shahzad! I manage the Design aspects of Potentia Robotics, specifically working on CAD and design. We use Autodesk Fusion 360 to create realistic models of our robot, allowing us to visualize how each subsection of the humanoid works in tandem with the others. I applied to join the team because of the unique goal of the club. In the past, I’ve worked on countless robots, but none are as intriguing as a full size humanoid. I’m grateful for being brought into the club, and it’s been a pleasure working with the Design team and other Engineering members to create our robot.

          Hey! I’m Rushil, and I’m working on heading the main engineering team for the bot. We’re hard at work designing the chassis, running logistics for the fabrication of parts, and making the programmers happy. From CAD to cardboard prototype to 3D print to machining and final construction we’re working to design and engineer the final product!
